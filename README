= Radiant Consumer

This is a plugin that allows importing content from radiant page parts or
snippets into another Rails project.

== INSTALL

Requires RadiantCommodity extension to be installed in your radiant from
http://github.com/boost/radiant-commodity

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/boost/radiant-consumer.git

== CONFIGURATION

In your environment file or an initializer:

  RadiantConsumer.options = {
    :radiant_url => 'http://radiant.example.com',
    :expire_after => 10.minutes,
    :timeout => 5,
    :test_content => "Example content"
  }

Options:
:radiant_url:: The URL of the radiant installation. This should be the base URL.
:expire_after:: The amount of time, in seconds, to cache the fetched content before fetching again.
:timeout:: The amount of time, in seconds, to timeout the request to fetch the content.
:environment_content:: Content to return for an environment instead of actually fetching.
:username:: Will use basic authentication if set
:password:: Password for basic authentication

In the above example any content will be refetched every 10 minutes, and the
connection will timeout after 5 seconds. In the test environemnt all helpers
will return "Example content".

== USAGE

In your views you can import a page body using:

  <%= radiant_page('about') %>

This will fetch the page contents from http://radiant.example.com/about. The
layout will not be included.

To fetch a page part:

  <%= radiant_page_part('about', 'footer') %>

And to fetch a page snippet:

  <%= radiant_snippet('snippet_name') %>
